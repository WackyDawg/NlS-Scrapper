 Content Notes: *Maximum wireless signal rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual wireless data throughput, coverage, and quantity of connected devices are not guaranteed and will vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, and environmental factors, including building materials, obstacles, volume and density of traffic, and client location.
**Use of WiFi 6 (802.11ax), and features including OFDMA, DL/UL MU-MIMO, 1024-QAM, HE160, and WPA3 requires clients to also support the corresponding features. Not all 160 MHz channels may be available in some regions/countries due to regulatory restrictions.
△Multi-gig or 2.5 Gbps internet speeds require compatible service plans and equipment. Maximum wired signal rates are the physical rates. Actual data throughput is not guaranteed and may vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, the rate supported by the network cable, internet service provider factors, and other environmental factors.
§Mesh networking requires two or more devices. This product is compatible with standardized EasyMesh technology but has not obtained the Wi-Fi EasyMeshTM certification. Seamless Roaming is designed for devices that support the 802.11k/v standards.
†HomeShield  is under development, it could be available in Q2 2024. HomeShield includes the Free Basic Plan, fees apply for the Pro Plan. Visit tp-link.com/homeshield for more information. Some features are under development and will be supported with subsequent software updates.
