 Content Notes: *Maximum wireless signal rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual wireless data throughput and wireless coverage are not guaranteed and will vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, and environmental factors, including building materials, obstacles, volume and density of traffic, and client location.
**Use of WiFi 6 (802.11ax), and other features including OFDMA, 1024-QAM, TWT, MU-MIMO, and WPA3 requires clients to also support the corresponding features.
§HomeShield includes the Free Basic Plan. Fees apply for the Pro Plan. Visit tp-link/homeshield for more information.
†Acutual DSL downlink speeds vary between households. Factors affecting DSL speeds include the internet service level, real-time network capacity, equipment and client limitations, environmental factors.
‡Clients need to support 802.11k/v/r and may require additional set up. Performance may vary depending on the client's device.
△Gigabit internet speeds require compatible service plans and equipment. All WAN/LAN ports will operate as either WAN or LAN ports. Only one port can serve as a WAN port at a time.
Actual network speed may be limited by the rate of the product's Ethernet WAN or LAN port, the rate supported by the network cable, internet service provider factors and other environmental conditions.
