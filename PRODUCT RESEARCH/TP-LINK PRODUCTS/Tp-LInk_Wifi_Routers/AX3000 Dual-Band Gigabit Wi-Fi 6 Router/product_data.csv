 Content Notes: *Maximum wireless signal rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual wireless data throughput and wireless coverage are not guaranteed and will vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, and environmental factors, including building materials, obstacles, volume and density of traffic, and client location.
**Use of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), and its features including OFDMA, and 1024-QAM require clients to also support the corresponding features.
