 Content Notes: *Maximum wireless signal rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual wireless data throughput and wireless coverage, and quantity of connected devices are not guaranteed and will vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, and environmental factors, including building materials, obstacles, volume and density of traffic, and client location.
**Some features will require two or more units.
***Seamless roaming/No-Drop WiFi refers to the WiFi roaming that supports IEEE 802.11 k/v/r protocol, helping connected devices search and shift from one AP to another within 0.3 seconds. Clients need to support 802.11 k/v/r and may require additional setup. Performance may vary depending on the client device.
