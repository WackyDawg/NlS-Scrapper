 Content Notes: *Maximum wireless signal rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual wireless data throughput, coverage, and quantity of connected devices are not guaranteed and will vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, and environmental factors, including building materials, obstacles, volume and density of traffic, and client location.
**Use of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), and features including OFDMA, DL/UL MU-MIMO, 1024-QAM, HE160, and WPA3 requires clients to also support the corresponding features.
§Mesh network requires two or more devices.
†This product is compatible with standardized EasyMesh technology but has not obtained the Wi-Fi EasyMeshTM certification.
‡Actual network speed may be limited by the rate of the product's Ethernet WAN or LAN port, the rate supported by the network cable, internet service provider factors, and other environmental conditions.
△1000 Mbps internet speeds require compatible service plans and equipment.
