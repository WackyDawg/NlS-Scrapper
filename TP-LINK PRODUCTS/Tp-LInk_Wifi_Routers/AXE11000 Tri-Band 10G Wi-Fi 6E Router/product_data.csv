Highlights: 11 Gbps Tri-Band Wi-Fi: 4804 Mbps (6 GHz, HE160) + 4804 Mbps (5 GHz, HE160) + 1148 Mbps (2.4 GHz).*
10G Internet Connections: 1× 10 GbE WAN port, 1× 10 GbE LAN port, and 1× Gigabit LAN port ensure the ultimate wired and wireless internet access.†
Works on the 6 GHz Band: Minimizes congestion with greenfield spectrum, delivering robust high-speed connections.**
EasyMesh Compatible: Create a smart mesh network with seamless coverage and greater flexibility.‡
Connects More Devices: Serves multiple devices at once with OFDMA and MU-MIMO. All devices receive their data faster, and WiFi is used more efficiently.*
Enhanced Security: WPA3 encryption, Multi-SSID, and parental controls provide a personalized and safer online experience.**
Remote Management: Supports TAUC (TP-Link Aginet Unified Cloud, based on TR-369) along with TR-069, TR-098, TR-181, TR-111, and TR-143 protocols.
 Content Notes: *Maximum wireless signal rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual wireless data throughput and wireless coverage are not guaranteed and will vary as a result of network conditions, client limitations, and environmental factors, including building materials, obstacles, volume and density of traffic, and client location.
**Use of WiFi 6 (802.11ax)/WiFi 6E and other features including OFDMA, 1024-QAM, TWT, MU-MIMO, and WPA3 requires clients to also support the corresponding features. Not all 160 MHz channels may be available in the 6 GHz band in some regions/countries due to regulatory restrictions.
†10 Gbps or multi-gig internet speeds require compatible service plans and equipment.
Actual network speed may be limited by the rate of the product's Ethernet WAN or LAN port, the rate supported by the network cable, Internet service provider factors and other environmental conditions. 2.5 Gbps internet speeds require compatible service plans and equipment.
‡This product is compatible with standardized EasyMesh technology but has not obtained the Wi-Fi EasyMeshTM certification.
