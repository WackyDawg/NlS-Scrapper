Note. Subscription Locked phones must be assigned to a user with a unique, personal UniFi Talk phone number and have an Internet connection to function. We recommend Subscription Unlocked phones for configurations where users only share numbers with a group and are not assigned a unique, personal UniFi Talk phone number.

UniFi Talk is available in the US, UK, and Canada. Additional international support is planned for 2024."
